### PDF Worker Configuration
- [x] PDF worker file exists: `public/pdf.worker.min.js` (1015KB)
- [x] PDF worker properly referenced in code
- [x] CDN fallback configured for worker loading
- [x] Headers configured in `next.config.js`

### Docker/Azure Configuration
- [x] `output: 'standalone'` added to `next.config.js`
- [x] Dockerfile copies public directory (line 33)
- [x] Build artifacts properly structured
- [x] No Dockerfile changes needed

### Code Quality

- [x] Improved error handling and logging
- [x] Backward compatible with existing code
- [x] No breaking changes to APIs

## What Changed

### Modified Files:
1. **components/InputBox.tsx**
   - Enhanced PDF text extraction with Y-position tracking
   - Added EOL (End of Line) marker support
   - Improved spacing and line break handling
   - Enhanced debugging logs

2. **next.config.js**
   - Added `output: 'standalone'` for proper Azure deployment

### New Files:
1. **PDF_EXTRACTION_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed technical documentation
2. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - This checklist

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   ```

2. **Test Locally (Optional):**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 \
     -e AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="your-endpoint" \
     -e AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key" \
     -e AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="your-deployment" \
     your-app-name
   ```

3. **Deploy to Azure:**
   - Use existing Azure deployment scripts
   - No changes to deployment process needed
   - Environment variables remain the same

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test Cases:
1. **Upload a standard PDF with text**
   - Expected: Text should be extracted with proper line breaks
   - Console should show: "Successfully extracted text from PDF"

2. **Upload a scanned/image-based PDF**
   - Expected: Message indicating no text extracted
   - Console should show: "PDF extraction returned no text"

3. **Check browser console**
   - Look for: "PDF.js version: 5.4.149"
   - Look for: "Configured PDF.js worker: local file"
   - Look for page processing logs

4. **Test multi-page PDFs**
   - Expected: All pages processed
   - Console shows: "Processing page X of Y"

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If any issues arise, revert these commits:
- InputBox.tsx: Revert to previous text extraction logic
- next.config.js: Remove `output: 'standalone'` line

The changes are isolated and can be easily reverted without affecting other functionality.

## Expected Improvements

### Before Fix:
- PDFs might return concatenated text without line breaks
- Document structure lost
- Hard to read extracted text

### After Fix:
- ✅ Proper line breaks preserved
- ✅ Document structure maintained
- ✅ Better spacing and formatting
- ✅ Improved error messages
- ✅ Enhanced debugging capabilities

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. **PDF upload success rate**: Should remain high
2. **Text extraction quality**: Users should report better results
3. **Error logs**: Check for PDF.js worker errors
4. **Performance**: Should be similar to before (no degradation)

## Support Contact

If issues arise:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Review PDF_EXTRACTION_FIX_SUMMARY.md for technical details
3. Verify PDF worker file is accessible at `/pdf.worker.min.js`
4. Check that environment variables are properly set

## Notes

- The PDF.js library version (5.4.149) remains unchanged
- All dependencies are identical to before
- No new npm packages added
- Azure configuration unchanged
- Environment variables unchanged

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Deployment
**Risk Level**: Low (isolated changes, backward compatible)
**Recommended Action**: Deploy to production
